After my father passed away in 2019, I felt the need for a new activity in life.  Sports have always been and continue to be significant, but I wanted to find something creative to express myself.  My father always had a workbench and collected many tools.  I often found myself playing with them to make things, take things apart, and more often than not break things.  Self-inflicted injuries were not uncommon.

Having a variety of tools of my own, I started fidgeting with different materials, mostly wood and steel.  A small pocket knife was partially broken so I separated the parts and crafted a new handle of walnut.  Next I disassembled a pair of scissors, ground and sharpened them into knife blades, and set them in brass pipe fittings.I was hooked.

To really create with wood, you need a lathe to turn and fabricate round objects.  Not willing to spend the hundreds let alone thousands of dollars for a proper lathe and not knowing how long this pastime would last, I created my own.  I mounted my variable speed power drill, manufactured a turning mandrel out of a threaded steel rod and some bearings.  I turned a handsome piece of wood into a handle for a bottle opener.  Searching the internet I learned of hobby crafts kits to make pens and handles for shavers.I set out to make a collection of these as family Christmas gifts.

My curiosity for new projects has let me to making many more things.  Mostly what I make is a mess of the garage and an angry wife.  And a lot of damaged fingers but so far no trips to the emergency room.  While COVID-19 has halted my golf, tennis and other sports, it has provided more time for goofing off in the garage.

Special appreciation goes to my son Mitchell, the computer code geek and professional web designer, for helping me create this website.
